Zajal
=====

A blend of [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org), [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) and a clean consistent syntax, Zajal is an awesome live creative coding tool.

Can I use it?
-------------
Sure! The easiest way to get started is to grab the [latest stable release](https://zajal.cc/release/cocoa/Zajal-0.3.3.zip) off of the [main site](http://zajal.cc). The built in examples under Help > Examples and the [sketch book](http://sketch.zajal.cc) are a great place to start learning the language. [The documentation](http://docs.zajal.cc/) is also an option, but is pretty messy at the moment.

You'll need a Mac running OSX 10.6 or later. We're working on Windows/Linux support, but we're not there yet!

Bleeding Edge
-------------
If you're more interested in new features than stability, you can grab the source code off of this repository.

    $ git clone http://github.com/nasser/zajal.git
    $ cd zajal
    $ make
    $ ./bin/zajal examples/ballerina.rb
